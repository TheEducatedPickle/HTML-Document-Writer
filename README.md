# HTML Builder
HTML Builder is a tool designed to introduce aspiring web developers to HTML by providing a user friendly method for building HTML documents.
It features a complete GUI built with React.js and Material UI.

# Structure
HTML Builder uses a tree of HTMLElements to store user input. The output HTML file is rendered by InputTreeToHTML.js, which traverses the
tree by depth first.
